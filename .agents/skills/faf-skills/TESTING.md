## Skill Trigger Phrase Testing

### Test 6: Expected Activation Patterns

**Skills are designed to activate on these natural language phrases:**

**faf-teacher:**
- "What is FAF?"
- "Explain project.faf"
- "Why do I need this?"
- "How does AI context work?"

**faf-init:**
- "Set up project context"
- "Initialize FAF"
- "Create project DNA"

**faf-score:**
- "What's my AI-readiness score?"
- "Check my FAF quality"
- "What tier am I at?"

**faf-enhance:**
- "Improve my score"
- "Enhance my FAF"
- "Reach Gold tier"

**faf-sync:**
- "Sync my files"
- "Mirror to CLAUDE.md"

**faf-migrate:**
- "Upgrade my FAF format"
- "Migrate to latest version"

**faf-validate:**
- "Validate my FAF"
- "Check format"
- "Is this correct?"

**faf-docs:**
- "How does FAF work?"
- "Show me the docs"

**faf-git:**
- "Should I commit project.faf?"
- "Add FAF to Git"

**faf-platforms:**
- "Does FAF work with Claude Desktop?"
- "CLI vs MCP - which one?"

**Status:** ⏳ REQUIRES LIVE TESTING (Need Claude Code restart)

## Test Summary

**Total Tests:** 8
**Passed:** 7
**Pending:** 1 (Live activation testing - requires Claude Code restart)
**Failed:** 0

**Overall Status:** ✅ READY FOR PUBLICATION

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. ⏳ **Live Activation Testing** - Restart Claude Code and test natural language triggers
2. ⏳ **User Acceptance Testing** - Have another user install and test
3. ⏳ **GitHub Publication** - Create repository and publish

### Future:
- Create video demonstration of skills in action
- Gather community feedback
- Add more specialized skills based on usage patterns
- Create skill marketplace submission

---

## Known Limitations

**Current State:**
- Skills tested via file format validation only
- Live activation testing requires Claude Code restart
- No automated testing infrastructure (Skills are markdown, not code)
- Activation patterns based on description matching (Claude's internal logic)

**Acceptable Trade-offs:**
- No TypeScript = No Jest testing needed
- Manual testing sufficient for markdown content
- Skill quality measured by content completeness, not code coverage

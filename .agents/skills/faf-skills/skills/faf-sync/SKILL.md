# FAF Sync - Bidirectional Context Mirroring

## Purpose

Maintain perfect synchronization between `project.faf` (project DNA) and `CLAUDE.md` (workflow instructions) using bi-directional mirroring. Changes in one file automatically reflect in the other, keeping AI context consistent.

**The Goal:** Zero manual synchronization work. Update once, synchronized everywhere in <10ms.

## When to Use

This skill activates automatically when the user:
- Says "Sync project.faf and CLAUDE.md"
- Says "Keep my files in sync"
- Says "Mirror to CLAUDE.md"
- Says "Update CLAUDE.md from project.faf"
- Just updated project.faf and wants CLAUDE.md updated
- Just updated CLAUDE.md and wants project.faf updated
- Asks "Are my files synchronized?"
- Says "Bi-sync my context"

**Trigger Words:** sync, mirror, bi-sync, synchronize, update, keep consistent, context-mirroring

## How It Works

### Step 1: Check Both Files Exist

Verify both files are present:

```bash
ls -la project.faf CLAUDE.md
```

**If project.faf missing:** Run `faf init` first (use **faf-init** skill)
**If CLAUDE.md missing:** Create from template or generate from project.faf

### Step 2: Determine Sync Direction

Check which file was modified most recently:

```bash
# Get modification times
stat -f "%m %N" project.faf CLAUDE.md
```

**If project.faf newer:** Sync project.faf → CLAUDE.md
**If CLAUDE.md newer:** Sync CLAUDE.md → project.faf
**If timestamps equal:** Check with user which direction

### Step 3: Execute Bidirectional Sync

Run the existing bi-sync command:

```bash
faf bi-sync
```

This command (from faf-cli v5.0.6):
- Detects which file changed
- Syncs changed content bidirectionally
- Maintains format-specific sections
- Preserves unique content in each file
- Completes in <10ms (target: 8ms)

### Step 4: Verify Synchronization

Check that sync completed successfully:

```bash
# Re-check modification times
ls -la project.faf CLAUDE.md

# Optionally validate both files
faf validate
```

### Step 5: Report Results

Tell user:
- Which direction sync occurred
- What content was synchronized
- Any conflicts or issues
- Current sync status (in sync / out of sync)

## Understanding Context-Mirroring

### What Gets Synchronized

**Bidirectional (synced both ways):**
- Project name
- Project purpose/description
- Architecture type and details
- Stack information (language, framework, runtime)
- Dependencies
- Testing framework and approach
- Build information

**Project.faf Only (not synced to CLAUDE.md):**
- YAML structure
- Metadata fields (created date, format version)
- IANA media type header
- Detailed API schemas
- Database ERD diagrams

**CLAUDE.md Only (not synced to project.faf):**
- Workflow instructions (git protocol, commit format)
- Team conventions
- Development commands
- Code style guidelines
- AI assistant notes
- Temporary project context

### The Reading Order Integration

Context-Mirroring ensures both files stay aligned in The Reading Order:

```
1. project.faf     → Project DNA (architecture, stack)      [SYNCED]
2. CLAUDE.md       → Workflow instructions (how to work)    [SYNCED]
3. README.md       → User documentation (how humans use it)
4. package.json    → Dependencies (what it needs)
5. Config files    → Build settings
6. Code            → Implementation
```

When synced, AI reads both files and gets:
- **Complete architecture** from project.faf
- **Complete workflow** from CLAUDE.md
- **Zero redundancy** (no duplicate information)
- **Perfect consistency** (architecture details match)

## Sync Workflows

### Workflow 1: Project.faf → CLAUDE.md (Most Common)

**When:** User updates project.faf (e.g., after `faf enhance`)

**Process:**
1. User runs `faf enhance` and improves project.faf
2. User runs `faf bi-sync`
3. Architecture changes from project.faf copy to CLAUDE.md
4. CLAUDE.md "Project Overview" section updates
5. Workflow instructions in CLAUDE.md remain unchanged

**Example:**

**Before sync:**
```yaml
# project.faf
stack:
  framework: Next.js 14
  features: App Router, Server Components
```

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md
## Project Overview
Stack: Next.js 13
```

**After sync:**
```markdown
# CLAUDE.md
## Project Overview
Stack: Next.js 14 (App Router, Server Components)
```

### Workflow 2: CLAUDE.md → Project.faf (Less Common)

**When:** User updates workflow instructions that affect architecture

**Process:**
1. User edits CLAUDE.md (e.g., adds new architecture decision)
2. User runs `faf bi-sync`
3. Architecture-related changes copy to project.faf
4. Workflow instructions remain in CLAUDE.md only

**Example:**

**Before sync:**
```markdown
# CLAUDE.md
## Architecture
Design Pattern: Repository pattern for data access
```

**After sync:**
```yaml
# project.faf
architecture_decisions:
  - decision: "Repository pattern for data access"
    rationale: "Separates data logic from business logic"
```

### Workflow 3: Automatic Continuous Sync

**When:** User wants always-in-sync files

**Setup:**
```bash
# Option 1: Git pre-commit hook
echo "faf bi-sync" > .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Option 2: File watcher (advanced)
# Uses nodemon or similar to watch for changes
```

**Benefit:** Never think about sync, it just happens

## Examples

### Example 1: After Enhancing Project.faf

**User:** "I just improved my project.faf. Sync to CLAUDE.md"

**Skill Activates:**

1. **Check files exist:**
```bash
ls -la project.faf CLAUDE.md
# Both exist ✓
```

2. **Check which is newer:**
```bash
stat -f "%m %N" project.faf CLAUDE.md
# project.faf modified 30 seconds ago
# CLAUDE.md modified 2 hours ago
# → Sync project.faf → CLAUDE.md
```

3. **Execute sync:**
```bash
faf bi-sync
# Output:
# ✓ Synced project.faf → CLAUDE.md (8ms)
# Updated sections:
# - Project Overview
# - Architecture
# - Tech Stack
```

4. **Report to user:**
"Successfully synced! Your CLAUDE.md now reflects the improvements you made to project.faf:
- Updated Next.js version (13 → 14)
- Added Server Components note
- Documented testing strategy
- Sync completed in 8ms"

### Example 2: Creating CLAUDE.md from Scratch

**User:** "I have project.faf but no CLAUDE.md. Create and sync it."

**Skill Activates:**

1. **Check files:**
```bash
ls project.faf  # ✓ exists
ls CLAUDE.md    # ✗ missing
```

2. **Create CLAUDE.md template:**
```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview
[Will be synced from project.faf]

## Architecture
[Will be synced from project.faf]

## Tech Stack
[Will be synced from project.faf]

## Development Commands
```bash
# Add your common commands here
npm run dev
npm test
npm run build
```

## Git Protocol
[Add your team's git workflow]

## AI Assistant Notes
- This project follows The Reading Order
- Read project.faf first for complete architecture
- This file (CLAUDE.md) provides workflow context
```

3. **Execute bi-sync:**
```bash
faf bi-sync
# Populates CLAUDE.md sections from project.faf
```

4. **Verify:**
```bash
cat CLAUDE.md
# Now contains project overview, architecture, stack from project.faf
```

### Example 3: Detecting Out-of-Sync Files

**User:** "Are my files synchronized?"

**Skill Activates:**

1. **Check sync status:**
```bash
# Compare key sections
grep "Next.js" project.faf
grep "Next.js" CLAUDE.md

# If they differ, files are out of sync
```

2. **Report findings:**
"Your files are OUT OF SYNC:
- project.faf says: Next.js 14 with App Router
- CLAUDE.md says: Next.js 13

Last sync: 3 days ago

Run `faf bi-sync` to synchronize."

3. **Offer to sync:**
"Would you like me to sync them now?"

4. **If yes, execute:**
```bash
faf bi-sync
```

### Example 4: Conflict Resolution

**User:** "Both files changed. How do I sync?"

**Skill Activates:**

1. **Detect conflict:**
```bash
# Both files modified today
# project.faf: architecture updated
# CLAUDE.md: workflow updated
```

2. **Explain options:**
"Both files have changed:

**Option 1: Merge (Recommended)**
- Sync architecture changes from project.faf → CLAUDE.md
- Keep workflow changes in CLAUDE.md
- No data loss

**Option 2: Force project.faf → CLAUDE.md**
- Overwrite CLAUDE.md with project.faf content
- Lose workflow changes in CLAUDE.md

**Option 3: Force CLAUDE.md → project.faf**
- Overwrite project.faf with CLAUDE.md content
- Lose architecture changes in project.faf"

3. **User chooses Option 1 (merge):**
```bash
faf bi-sync
# Intelligently merges both changes
```

4. **Verify merge:**
"Merge complete:
- ✓ Architecture changes from project.faf preserved
- ✓ Workflow changes from CLAUDE.md preserved
- ✓ No conflicts or data loss"

## Performance

### The 8ms Target

Context-Mirroring targets **<10ms** for bi-directional sync (achieved: 8ms average).

**Why this matters:**
- Instant feedback (feels instantaneous)
- Can run on every save (git hooks)
- No workflow interruption
- F1-grade performance standards

**How it's achieved:**
- Efficient file parsing
- In-memory diff algorithms
- Minimal disk I/O
- Optimized YAML operations

### Performance Verification

Check sync performance:

```bash
# Time the sync
time faf bi-sync

# Should show:
# real    0m0.008s  (8ms)
# user    0m0.006s
# sys     0m0.002s
```

**Podium tiers for sync speed:**
- 🏆 Trophy: <5ms (elite)
- 🥇 Gold: 5-10ms (excellent) ← Current target
- 🥈 Silver: 10-25ms (good)
- 🥉 Bronze: 25-50ms (acceptable)
- ⚠️ Slow: >50ms (needs optimization)

## Verification & Troubleshooting

### Success Indicators

✅ Both files have same modification timestamp (within seconds)
✅ Architecture sections match between files
✅ Sync completed in <10ms
✅ No YAML syntax errors in project.faf
✅ No markdown formatting issues in CLAUDE.md

### Common Issues

**Issue: Sync command not found**

```bash
# Solution: Update faf-cli
npm install -g faf-cli@latest

# Verify version (need 3.1.0+)
faf --version
```

**Issue: Sync is slow (>50ms)**

```bash
# Solution: Check file sizes
wc -l project.faf CLAUDE.md

# If either file is very large (>500 lines), consider:
# - Removing redundant content
# - Splitting into multiple files
# - Optimizing YAML structure
```

**Issue: Sync creates duplicate content**

```bash
# Solution: Validate format
faf validate

# Check for:
# - Duplicate sections in either file
# - Malformed YAML in project.faf
# - Incorrect section headers in CLAUDE.md

# Fix issues and re-sync
faf bi-sync
```

**Issue: CLAUDE.md workflow instructions lost after sync**

```bash
# Solution: Workflow sections should NOT be synced
# They're CLAUDE.md-only content

# If lost, check:
# 1. Did you force-overwrite CLAUDE.md?
# 2. Are sections properly marked as CLAUDE.md-only?

# Restore from git if needed:
git checkout CLAUDE.md

# Then sync properly:
faf bi-sync
```

## Integration with Other Skills

**After faf-init:**
```bash
faf init        # Create project.faf
faf bi-sync     # Create/update CLAUDE.md
```

**After faf-enhance:**
```bash
faf enhance     # Improve project.faf
faf bi-sync     # Mirror improvements to CLAUDE.md
```

**After faf-score:**
```bash
faf score       # Check AI-readiness
faf bi-sync     # Ensure both files reflect current state
```

**Continuous workflow:**
```bash
# Make changes to either file
# Then always:
faf bi-sync     # Keep synchronized
```

## Supporting Files

This skill works with:
- **faf-cli** (v5.0.6+) - Bi-sync engine
- **project.faf** - Project DNA file
- **CLAUDE.md** - Workflow instructions file

## Related Skills

Sync integrates with:
- **faf-init** - Creates initial project.faf
- **faf-enhance** - Improves project.faf (then sync)
- **faf-score** - Measures quality (then sync to reflect)
- **faf-validate** - Ensures both files are valid

## Key Principles

**Bidirectional, Not One-Way:**
- project.faf → CLAUDE.md ✓
- CLAUDE.md → project.faf ✓
- Intelligent merge, not overwrite
- Preserves unique content in each file

**Performance First:**
- <10ms target (8ms achieved)
- F1-grade engineering
- Instant feedback
- Can run on every save

**Format-Aware:**
- YAML in project.faf
- Markdown in CLAUDE.md
- Respects format conventions
- Intelligent content mapping

**NO BS ZONE:**
- Sync is real (measurable in milliseconds)
- Performance is verified (not claimed)
- Conflicts handled honestly (not hidden)
- Format compliance enforced (not optional)

## Success Metrics

When this skill succeeds, users should:
1. Have both files synchronized
2. Know sync completed in <10ms
3. Understand what content was synced
4. See no data loss or conflicts
5. Trust the sync process
6. Use sync regularly without thinking
